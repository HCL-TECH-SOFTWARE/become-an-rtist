# Bill of Materials
You need some hardward to build the BecomeAnRTist game.

* __Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Premium Kit__ (approx cost 90 USD)

This means the Raspberry Pi itself as well as necessary accessories such as the plastic case cover, power supply, HDMI cable, 16 GB Micro-SD card with Raspbian OS installed

* __Short ethernet cable__ (approx cost 2 USD)


* __Pi Camera V2 Daylight__ (approx cost 30 USD)

* __Big red push button__ (approx cost 10 USD)

For example: Adafruit Massive Arcade Button with LED

* __Camera case__ (approx cost 15 USD)

It's good if it allows you to adjust the camera angle. For example: Cookie wheel camera case

* __Resistors and wires for connecting things together__ (approx cost 15 USD)

For example: The PiHut Ultimate Resistor Kit

Arcade Button Quick-Connect Wire Pairs - 0.11" (10 pack)

* __LED desk lamp with good bright light__ (approx cost 50 USD)

It's good if it has a "long flat" lamp so it can be more easily attached to the scaffolding.

* __Paper and marker pen__ (approx cost 20 USD)

Ordinary printer paper will work (although expect to use a lot since a sketch usually "bleeds" through on the opposite side of the paper). Use a black marker pen with a 1-3 mm head.

* __Material for building a scaffolding__ (approx cost 20 USD)

For example, the base can be a wooden or plastic tray with attached metal plates (those used when building walls in houses). They are strong and have pre-drilled holes where M5 screws will fit. It's good to cover the tray with for example a white paper, and use duct tape for marking on it the anticipated position of the paper.
