# Bill of Material
You need some hardware to build the BecomeAnRTist game.

* __Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (or newer) Premium Kit__ (approx cost 90 USD)

This means the Raspberry Pi itself as well as necessary accessories such as the plastic case cover, power supply, HDMI cable, 16 GB Micro-SD card with Raspbian OS installed.

* __Short ethernet cable__ (approx cost 2 USD)


* __Pi Camera V2 Daylight__ (approx cost 30 USD)

* __Big red push button__ (approx cost 10 USD)

For example: Adafruit Massive Arcade Button with LED

* __Camera case__ (approx cost 15 USD)

It's good if it allows you to adjust the camera angle. For example: Cookie wheel camera case

As an alternative, you can choose to mount the camera directly under the lamp, so you can adjust the camera by adjusting the lamp itself. In this case you can buy a longer camera cable so you can have the Pi on the table and the camera under the lamp.

* __Resistors and wires for connecting things together__ (approx cost 15 USD)

For example: The PiHut Ultimate Resistor Kit

You may use a resistor when connecting the push button to the Pi, but it is strictly not necessary, so consider this an optional buy.

Arcade Button Quick-Connect Wire Pairs - 0.11" (10 pack)

![wires](https://github.com/hcl-pnp-rtist/become-an-rtist/blob/master/images/pi_wires.png "Wires")

These wires are for connecting the push button to the Pi. Which wires to use depend on the button.

* __LED desk lamp with good bright light__ (approx cost 50 USD)

![lamp](https://github.com/hcl-pnp-rtist/become-an-rtist/blob/master/images/desklamp.png "Desk lamp")

It's good if the lamp is stable enough so it can carry both the Pi and the camera. Alternatively, keep the Pi on the table and just attach the camera on the lamp since it is considerably lighter. In this case you need a longer than default camera cable. If you choose to attach the Pi on the lamp you may need a scaffolding to make the construction stable enough.

* __Paper and marker pen__ (approx cost 20 USD)

Ordinary printer paper will work (although expect to use a lot since a sketch usually "bleeds" through on the opposite side of the paper). Use a black marker pen with a 1-3 mm head.
As an alternative you can use a white board with white board pens and an eraser. We have tested this and it works, but you need to make sure it's not giving too much reflections since that could cause image recognition to fail.

* __Material for building a scaffolding__ (approx cost 20 USD)

The purpose of the scaffolding is to make the construction stable enough so the lamp won't fall down. Depending on the lamp you use you may or may not need it. If you choose to have a scaffolding, its base can be a wooden or plastic tray with attached metal plates (those used when building walls in houses). They are strong and have pre-drilled holes where M5 screws will fit. It's good to cover the tray with for example a white paper, and use duct tape for marking on it the anticipated position of the paper.
